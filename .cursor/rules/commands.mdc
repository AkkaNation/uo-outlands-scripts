Commands
Command Overview¶
The commands issued in the scripting engine are similar to commands you might enter into a command prompt or shell. Each line has a starting command and a set of parameters. Some of those parameters are required, some are optional.

command (required) [optional]

All parameters are shown inside of parenthesis or brackets. Parameters within parenthesis are required while those in brackets are optional and will default to specific value if not provided.

If you want to pass several words as a single parameter you must wrap them using ' or ". For example 'hello goodbye' is one parameter, while hello goodbye is two.

For example, if your script is something like:

# Say 'Hello'
say Hello friends!
You will end up just saying Hello. Instead, you if you wrap the words in single (') or double quotes (") the engine will see it as a single parameter.

# Say 'Hello friends!'
say 'Hello friends!'
If you prefix a command with the @ this will silence any warning/output from the command. For example:

Example

// Generate warning if robe is out of reach
lifttype 'robe'

// Silence warning if robe is out of reach
@lifttype 'robe'
Without the @ symbol, if a robe isn't available, you would get an warning message telling you that it couldn't find a robe. But since the @ symbol was provided, no warning is displayed.
